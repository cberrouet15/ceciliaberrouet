ðŸ“š With six months left in my **MSc Computer Science final project**, Iâ€™m currently deep in the **literature review stage**.  

My research explores how **semi-supervised learning (SSL)** can be applied to the challenge of **food image classification** â€” a domain where labeling is costly and food images are highly variable. Iâ€™m examining methods like pseudo-labeling, consistency regularization, and GAN-based augmentation to understand their potential for reducing reliance on large labeled datasets.  

Itâ€™s still early days, but Iâ€™m excited to build on this foundation and begin implementation in the months ahead. ðŸš€
