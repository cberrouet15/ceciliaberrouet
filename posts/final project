ðŸš§ Wrapping up my **MSc Computer Science final project**!  

Iâ€™ve been working on applying **semi-supervised learning (SSL)** to the challenge of **food image classification** â€” a domain where labeling data is expensive and images are highly variable. The project explores how SSL methods like pseudo-labeling, consistency regularization, and GAN-based augmentation can bridge the gap between limited labeled data and real-world complexity.  

Itâ€™s been exciting but also full of challenges: noisy labels, generalization issues, and computational trade-offs. Looking forward to finishing strong and sharing more soon! ðŸš€
